# Auto Update Website (starter)

This is a small starter static website you can use as a base for a GitHub-hosted site.
It includes:
- `index.html`, simple layout
- `styles/` and `scripts/`
- GitHub Actions workflow to publish to GitHub Pages

## How to use

1. Create a new GitHub repository (or use an existing one).
2. Replace the placeholder content in this project with your own.
3. Push to `main`. The workflow included will publish the `gh-pages` branch using the action.

## Files to edit
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles/styles.css` — styling
- `scripts/script.js` — client-side JS
